## Aristotle's Inductive Argument
### useful for giving the mechanics of how this argument is given
Least amount of people is one person: no [[Politics]] since there is no conflict of wills
Family: no [[Politics]] since all are related; parental authority introduced < child's wills are formed toward the parent 
Tribe: no [[Politics]] since all are related, even if more distantly; customs suffice for disagreements < biological tie so no politics. Customs suffice for disagreements (usually chief enforces customs)
Village/Small City/Polis (Greek for city): formed when multiple tribes chose to live together; [[Politics]] present
