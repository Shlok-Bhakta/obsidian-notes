# Notes
Let p and q be [[Proposition]]s

The conditional of if p then q (p → q) ==  if p: q

Think of it as an if statement but more confusing

The truth of q is dependent on the truth of p only if p is true if not its impossible to tell

p: T
q: F
p -> q: F
!p v q: T

p: F
q: F
p -> q: T

p: T
q: T
p -> q: T

p: F
q: T
p -> q: T




# Example
p: it is raining
q: the home team wins

p → q: **if** it is raining, the home team wins
