# Notes
Let p and q be [[Proposition]]s

The exclusive or of p and q (p ⨁ q) == p ^ q == p XOR q

Think of it as an XOR gate (If they are the same then False)

# Example (p ⨁ q)
p: A student can have salad with dinner
q: A student can have soup with dinner

p ⨁ q: A student can have soup or salad, but not both, with dinner
