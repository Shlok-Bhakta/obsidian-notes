# Notes
Let p and q be [[Proposition]]s

The disjunction of p and q (p v q) == p || q == p OR q

Think of it as an OR gate (If any are true then true)

# Example (p v q)
p: A student who has taken calculus can take this class
q: A student who took Introductory CS can take this course

p v q: Students who have taken calculus **or** introductory CS can take this course
