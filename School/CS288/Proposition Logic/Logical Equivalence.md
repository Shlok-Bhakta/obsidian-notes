# Definition
Compound [[Proposition]]s that have the same truth values in all possible cases

the compound propositions x and y are called logically equivalent if x ↔ y [[Tautology]] 

# Examples
show that ¬(p -> q) ≡ p ∧ ¬q are [[Logical Equivalence]] 

¬(p -> q) ≡ ¬(¬p ∧ q) by conditional disjunction equivalence 

¬(¬p ∧ q) ≡ ¬(¬p) ∧ ¬q by [[De Morgan's Laws]] 

¬(¬p) ∧ ¬q ≡ p ∧ ¬q by the double negation law
