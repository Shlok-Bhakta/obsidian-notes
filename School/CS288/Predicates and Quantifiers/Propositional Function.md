# Definition 
[[Function]] P 
- takes one or more variables
- express a [[Predicate]] involving the variables 

Generalization of [[Proposition]] 



# Notes
The [[Domain]] of a propositional [[Function]] is the set of possible values of the variables 

The [[Domain]] must be defined

The range is the set of [[Proposition]] formed by replacing the variables with each of the possible values from the [[Domain]] 
# Example
## Example 1
P(x, y): x + y = 1 where x and y are Real Numbers

p(x, y) is not a [[Proposition]] because it isn't true or false

p(1, 0) is a [[Proposition]] 

## Example 2
Let Q(x, y) denote the statement "x = y + 3" What are the truth values of the propositions Q(1, 2) and Q(3, 0)?

Q(1, 2) : 1 = 2+3 False 

Q(3, 0): 3 = 0+3 True
