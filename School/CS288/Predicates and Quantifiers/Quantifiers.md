# Definition
A way to turn a [[Proposition]] into a [[Propositional Function]] 

[[Universal Quantifier]] : ∀
[[Existential Quantifier]] : ∃

## Quantifications

| Statement | When is True?                        | When is False?                 |
| --------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| ∀xP(x)    | P(x) is true for every x             | P(x) is false for any single x |
| ∃xP(x)    | There is an x for which P(x) is true | P(x) is false for every x                               |

# Notes
If domain is empty then ∀xP(x) is true for any function because there are no false elements

If domain is empty then ∃xP(x) is false for any function because there are no true elements

# Examples
## Example 1
for any real number x we always have x^2 >= 0

expressed as ∀x(x^2 >= 0)

It is true (for every real number x, x^2 >= 0)

## Example 2
∀x(x > 5)

It is false (because x = 4 is false)

## Example 3
There exists a real number x such that x > 5

expressed as ∃x(x>5)

True (one condition x = 6 is true)
