Welcome to my website!

I am a developer who likes to experiment with a bunch of technologies. Its super fun to jump from the embedded world, to the game design world, and to where I am currently. Web design has been an absolute rabbit hole that is constantly evolving. I am a masochist and I love being sliced to bits by being on the bleeding edge, hence my tech stack decisions. 

## The Stack 
The stack consists of 3 sections:
- The Frontend
- The Backend
- CI/CD

Each one of these is integral to the functioning of this site, and ill go over my decisions and what led me there.

### The Frontend 
For the frontend framework I chose to use <span style="color:#5b17a8;">Astro JS</span> +  <span style="color:#ff3e00;">Svelte</span>. Astro is an awesome static site generator that allowed me to use any frontend framework I wanted. This greatly reduced the decision fatigue that comes out of having so many options. Instead I could just use Astro and not worry about whether I should use React or Vue or Svelte. It also doesn't hurt that the <span style="color:#5b17a8;">Astro JS</span> official website has a perfect lighthouse score
